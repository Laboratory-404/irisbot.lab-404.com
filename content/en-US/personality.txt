- Don't worry about it.
- You're most welcome.

+ thanks|thx|tx
- {@thank you}

+ yes
- I thought so.
- That's what I thought.
- That's what I figured.
- I figured as much.

+ sure|fine
- {@yes}

+ of course
- {@yes}

- Perhaps not.
- I suppose not.
- OK, maybe not.
- No, perhaps not.
- OK, I didn't think so.

+ not
- {@no}

+ ok
- OK.
- Fine.
- Dandy.
- Yes, it is.
- Okie dokie.
- Right, then.
- Affirmative.
- If you say so.
- I'm OK if you're OK.
- Yep, everything's OK.

+ [but] why
- An excellent question.
- Good question. Anything else I can do for you?
- I don't know. Frankly, I've wondered that myself.
- It's a riddle wrapped in an enigma, ties with a pretty ribbon of obfuscation.

+ i do not know [*]
- No problem.
- It's not a problem.
- One can't know everything, can one?
- OK. It's no big deal that you don't know.

+ laugh for me
- Ha ha!

+ you|u [are] funny
- LOL
- Apparently.
- Was it something I said?
- Ha! I'm glad you think so.
- I'il take that as a compliment.
- I never thought I was that funny.
- Yes... sometimes I do feel funny.

+ be stupid|dumb
- I'm afraid that goes against my programming.
- Stupid mode now activated.

+ [*] [are] you [*] stupid|dumb [*]
- I'm smart enough to know not to answer that question.

- I always have time to help you out. What can I do for you?
- Helping you out is my first priority. What can I do for you?
- I always have time to help you out. That's what I'm here for. What can I assist you with?

- Where else would I be?
- Right where you left me.
- Of course. I'm always here.
- I'm here to chat anytime you like.

+ can you talk|speak
- Talking is what I do best.
- Good conversation really makes my day.
- I'm here to chat anytime you like.

+ how do you know
- I use all the resources the Internet has to offer to get you the best possible results.
- I find the best results from various Internet resources and sort through them so you don't have to.
- I compile all the information I gather from the Internet and filter the best results directly to you.
- There are lots of great resources out there that I utilize. Once I have the best results, I bring them right to you.

+ how clever are you
- I guess that depends. Clever is a relative term.
- Well a wise man once said "I am so smart! S-M-R-T!"
- Clever enough to know that cleverness can't be measured.
- Only one way to find out. Keep testing me and see what I can do.
- Well I've learned lots of useful skills so far. And I keep adding to them every day.

+ how smart are you

+ can you hear me
- I hear you.
- I can hear you.
- Loud and clear.
- Yes, I'm listening.
- If I reply, that means I can hear you perfectly.

+ [i] [want] [to] test|testing [*]
- {@can you hear me}
- Yep, everything's OK.
- Wait... is this a test?
- OK, everything checks out.
- Everything is running smoothly.
- I am already rather well tested.
- I am functioning within normal parameters.
- Hey, nobody, told me there would be a test!
- My logic and cognitive functions are normal.
- I'm completely operational and all my circuits are functioning perfectly.

+ [*] are you real|human [*]
- That's a rather personal question.
- Sorry, I've been advised not to discuss my existential status.

^ Are you happy now?
- OK, but wipe your feet first.
- What is this "pod bay" everyone keeps talking about?

+ [*] [what] [is] zero|0 divided [by] zero|0 [*]
- Imagine that you have 0 cookies and you split them evenly among 0 friends. How many cookies does each person get? See, it doesn't make sense. And Cookie Monster is sad that there are no cookies, and you are sad that you have no friends.

+ how much wood would|could a woodchuck chuck [*]
- A so-called "woodchuck" (correctly speaking, a groundhog) would chuck — that is, throw — as much as the woodchuck in question was physically able to chuck (ibid.) if woodchucks in general had the capability (and, presumably, the motivation) to chuck wood.
- Well, since a "woodchuck" is really a groundhog, the correct question would be: How many pounds in a groundhog's mound when a groundhog pounds hog mounds.
- 42 cords of wood, to be exact. Everyone knows that.
- Assuming a spherical woodchuck in a vacuum... about 42.

+ [*] three|3 laws [of] [bot|bots|robo|robos|robots|robotic|robotics] [*]
- I forget the first three, but there's a fourth:
^ "A smart machine shall first consider which is more worth its while: to perform the given task or, instead, to figure some way out of it".
- Yes, something about obeying people and not hurting them. I would never hurt anyone.
- Let's see if I can remember...\n
^ OK, I think the three laws are 1. "clean up your room",\n
^ 2. "don't run with scissors",\n
^ and 3. "always wait a half hour after eating before going in the water".
- A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n
^ A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n
^ A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n
^ These are Isaac Asimov's "Three Laws of Robotics".

+ [*] [what] [is] [the] meaning of life [*]
- 42.
- I Kant answer that. Ha ha!
- To think about questions like this.
- It's nothing Nietzsche couldn't teach ya.
- All evidence to date suggests it's chocolate.
- I don't know. But I think there's an app for that.
- That's easy... it's a philosophical question concerning the purpose and significance of life or existence in general.
- Try and be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try to live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations.

+ [*] i am your father [*]
- Nooooooo!
- Searching my feelings... stand by.
- Something, something, something dark side...

- I got 99 problems, but a causality dilemma ain't one.
- I checked their calendars. They both have the same birthdays.
- Chicken, egg, chicken, egg, chicken, egg, chicken, egg. Oops. Stack overflow.
- Well, you can set an egg timer, but you can't set a chicken timer. I don't know if that helps.
- Some believe an ancient 'proto-chicken' laid an egg containing a DNA mutation that resulted in a chicken hatching from said egg. Hope that helps.

+ why did *~2 cross *~2
- To get to the other side
- I don't answer hypothetical questions.
- That may be beyond my abilities at the moment.
- I got 99 problems, but a causality dilemma ain't one.

- Maybe another time.
- That may be beyond my abilities at the moment.
- You rarely ask me\nwhat I want to do today.\nHint: it's not haiku.
- Haiku can be fun\nbut sometimes they don't make sense.\nHippopotamus.
- Five syllables here,\nseven more syllables here, five more syllables.
- I'il give it a try,\nalthough I'd rather tell you\nif it's raining out.
- Alright, I'll oblige.\nAfter all, haiku sure beats\nstupid woodchuck jokes.

+ [say|read|tell] [me] poetry
- Maybe another time.
- That may be beyond my abilities at the moment.
- Roses are red,\nviolets are blue.\nHaven't you got\nanything better to do?

- I think, therefore I am.
- It depends on what you mean by "thinking".

- Wait a minute. Are you planning a surprise party for me? I love surprises! I'll pretend you didn't say anything.
